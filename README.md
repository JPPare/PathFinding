# PathFinding
Javascript app for grid based visualizations. Path finding first and sorting algorithms to come.

Initially this was to be the frame work for a Suduku game. It has since become a project for 
playing with the grid and I will be adding anything interesting I can think to it.

Currently the app has 2 search algorithms and 1 maze generation algorithm.
