# PathFinding
Javascript app for grid based visualizations. Path finding first and sorting algorithms to come.
Uses Webpack, Bootstrap and node.js

Initially this was to be the frame work for a Suduku game. It has since become a project for 
playing with the grid and I will be adding anything interesting I can think to it. 

Since this is just an app for personal use I am only testing it in Chrome and not worrying about 
support for anything outside of my setup at the time.
